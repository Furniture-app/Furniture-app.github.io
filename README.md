# Furniture-app.github.io
This is a project i made for the SoftUni JS Applications - February 2021 course.
I have written the JavaScript code for this application. The HTML and CSS were given to me as part of the project scaffold.
I have also adapted the project to work with Back4App(as a REST service).
